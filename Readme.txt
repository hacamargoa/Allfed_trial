Description
This scripts show a broad analysis of the potential effect of ozone anomalies (tropospheric and stratospheric) in food production
-locations_volcano.R: This script just map the volcanic vents and estimates the harvested areas of wheat, maize and rice affected by these vents by the production of tropospheric ozone which reduces the yield in plants. 
-UV_increase.R: This script estimates the reduction in wheat, maize and rice caused by the increase of UV radiation after a nuclear winter or solar flare that affects the ozone layer.
